# PubNub-iOS-Messaging
Example of how to use PubNub and Parse for real time messaging using iOS 9+, xCode 7 and Swift 2.0# PubNub-iOS-Messaging.  I'll try and update it as I learn more, but it's a good start!

#### Usage
1. Download zip file
2. If you don't already have CocoaPods, get that now ``gem install cocoapods``
3. Run ``pod install``
4. Launch project with ``open PubNubTest.xcworkspace/``
5. In AppDelegate.swift, replace YOUR_PARSE_APP_ID and YOUR_PARSE_CLIENT_KEY with your Parse App ID and Parse client key
6. In ViewController.swift replace YOUR_PUBNUB_PUBLISH_KEY with your PubNub publish key and YOUR_PUBNUB_SUBSCRIBE_KEY with your PubNub subscribe key
7. ??
8. Profit!
